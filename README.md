## What is this?

IsValid automates statistical tests for A/B experiments.  It will calculate significance and confidence intervials.

In short, you can use it to figure out what, if anything, the result of an A/B test means.

## How can I use it?

I host this exact code at [isvalid.org](http://isvalid.org).  If you want, you can host it yourself.

There is also an API (which you could host yourself!) that you can read about [here](https://github.com/evansolomon/IsValid.org/wiki/API).
